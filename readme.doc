Q: Both merges above are fast-forward merges. Explain
A: These are fast-forward merges because they merge in a linear path rather than jumping from one branch to another. The branches are always caught up with each other and not divided.

b: Scenario 1
Student A changes title to "Conflict 1" on develop branch, commits change and pushes. Then, student B changes title to "Conflict 2" on conflict_branch, and then commits change and pushes. Both students pull changes on respective branches. When student A tries to merge conflict_branch onto develop branch, they get a merge conflict, because of the conflicting titles on different branches. They will then need to accept the changes to resolve it.
